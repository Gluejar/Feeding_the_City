<p class="calibri4">At Open Book Publishers, we are changing the nature of the traditional academic book. The title you have just read will not be left on a library shelf, but will be accessed online by hundreds of readers each month across the globe. We make all our books free to read online so that students, researchers and members of the public who can&#x2019;t afford a printed edition can still have access to the same ideas as you.</p>
<p class="calibri4">Our digital publishing model also allows us to produce online supplementary material, including extra chapters, reviews, links and other digital resources. Find <i class="italic">Feeding the City</i> on our website to access its online extras. Please check this page regularly for ongoing updates, and join the conversation by leaving your own comments:</p>

<p class="calibri4">If you enjoyed this book, and feel that research like this should be available to all readers, regardless of their income, please think about donating to us. Our company is run entirely by academics, and our publishing decisions are based on intellectual merit and public value rather than on commercial viability. We do not operate for profit and all donations, as with all other revenue we generate, will be used to finance new Open Access publications.</p>
